I'm currently a medical student based in Ireland and previously worked as a global health epidemiologist with a background in public health. I'm interested in using data to improve decision-making and health system performance, particularly in low resource settings. My current work focuses on using data science to understand trends in maternal and child health, vaccine-preventable diseases, and tobacco/alcohol control.

I like data analysis, books (memoirs/biographies!), guitar (jazz!), coffee (lots!), and communicating science to a broader audience.
