I'm an epidemiologist from Canada taking a slight detour to medical school in Ireland. I'm interested in improving health equity, especially using clinical data to improve decision-making and health system performance in low resource settings. My work in public health focuses on understanding trends in maternal and child health, vaccine-preventable diseases, and tobacco/alcohol control.

In my personal time, I like books (memoirs/biographies!), guitar (jazz!), coffee (lots!), board games (Carcassonne!), and learning languages (slowly picking up French!).
